## Project Objective
Build a regression model to predict gold prices using historical data and economic indicators.  
This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

## Dataset
- Historical gold price data and related features.
- Location: `data/gold_price.csv`

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Model Performance
- **Best RMSE achieved:** 23.12
- **Algorithm used:** RandomForestRegressor
